# Welcome to My Data Analytics Portfolio üëã  

## About Me  

With six years of experience as a dedicated Project Manager, I have successfully led linguistic projects for international clients‚Äîcoordinating between translators and internal teams to ensure smooth and timely execution. Currently pursuing a doctorate in International Economics, I apply advanced data analysis techniques in both my coursework and thesis research.  

To support my transition into a data analysis role, I have completed the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate** and **IBM‚Äôs Databases and SQL for Data Science** course. My combined academic and professional experience has equipped me with a solid foundation in tools such as **Python, Stata, R, SQL, and Excel**, along with knowledge in **statistical modeling, regression analysis, and the fundamentals of machine learning**.  

I bring a unique blend of **analytical acumen, project management expertise, and a passion for uncovering insights through data** to any data-driven environment.

## üìÇ Portfolio Projects  

In this section, I list data analytics projects, briefly describing the **technology stack** and **methodologies** used.  

### **Python**  
#### üé¨ [What is the impact of marketing promotions (TV, social media, radio, and influencer) on a small business's historical sales.](link_to_project)  
**Code:** [`Automate video content classification into claims or opinions.ipynb`](link_to_notebook)  
**Goal:** Determine what type of promotion contributes most to a business's historical sale.  
**Description:**  
- Analyzed a dataset representing the amount of money spent on TV, radio, and social media promotions.  
- Performed **data exploration, data cleaning, multiple linear regression model building, and model assumptions checking.  
- Visualized trends to identify key success drivers.  
**Skills:** Data cleaning, statistical analysis, data visualization.  
**Tech:** Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, statsmodels).  
**Results:**  
‚úÖ High TV promotional budgets have a substantial positive influence on sales and investments in radio promotions also increases sales.

#### üíª [Building a binary classifier (claim vs. opinion) and regression model for video content analysis.](link_to_project)  
**Code:** [`Build a binary classifier model and regression model to categorize claim types in video content.ipynb`](link_to_notebook)  
**Goal:** Build a predictive model that can determine whether a video contains a claim or offers an opinion.  
**Description:**  
- Build a logistic regression model that analyzes a dataset consisting of claims classification data and then categorizes claim types in the video content.  
- Performed **data exploration, data cleaning, logistic regression model building, and model assumptions checking.  
- Visualized trends to identify key success drivers.  
**Skills:** Data cleaning, statistical analysis, data visualization, correlation matrices, histogram plotting, confusion matrices.  
**Tech:** Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, sklearn).  
**Results:**  
‚úÖ Based on the estimated model coefficients from the logistic regression, longer videos tend to be associated with higher odds of the user being verified..

### **SQL**  
#### ü¶† [Covid-19 Data Exploration](link_to_project)  
*(Describe your SQL queries, key findings, and tools used.)*  

#### üè† [Nashville Housing Data Cleaning](link_to_project)  
*(Highlight data cleaning techniques, SQL transformations, and outcomes.)*

### **Stata**  
#### üéÆ [Legendary Pok√©mon Analysis (Study Project)](link_to_project)  
*(Briefly explain the statistical methods and visualizations used.)*  

### **R**  
#### üéÆ [Legendary Pok√©mon Analysis (Study Project)](link_to_project)  
*(Briefly explain the statistical methods and visualizations used.)*  

### **Excel / Google Sheets**  
*(List any dashboard or analysis projects here.)*

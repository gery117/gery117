# Welcome to My Data Analytics Portfolio üëã  

## About Me  

With six years of experience as a dedicated Project Manager, I have successfully led linguistic projects for international clients‚Äîcoordinating between translators and internal teams to ensure smooth and timely execution. Currently pursuing a doctorate in International Economics, I apply advanced data analysis techniques in both my coursework and thesis research.  

To support my transition into a data analysis role, I have completed the **Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate** and **IBM‚Äôs Databases and SQL for Data Science** course. My combined academic and professional experience has equipped me with a solid foundation in tools such as **Python, Stata, R, SQL, and Excel**, along with knowledge in **statistical modeling, regression analysis, and the fundamentals of machine learning**.  

I bring a unique blend of **analytical acumen, project management expertise, and a passion for uncovering insights through data** to any data-driven environment.

**Tech:** Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, sklearn).  
**Results:**  
‚úÖ The models and the feature importances extracted from the models confirm that employees at the company are overworked and the number of the projects that employees work on should be capped as well as increaded rewards and promotions for employees that have worked longer hours.

#### üêç Developing a machine learning model (Decision tree and Random forest) to predict employee attrition and inform retention strategies.
**Code:** [`Build a machine learning model to predict employee attrition.ipynb`](https://github.com/gery117/gery117/blob/main/Salifort%20Motors%20capstone%20project%20machine%20learning.ipynb)  
**Goal:** To develop a machine learning data driven tool that predicts whether an employee is at risk of leaving the company, with the goal of enabling proactive retention strategies.  
**Description:**  
- Build a Decision tree model as well as a Random forest model that analyzes a dataset and that predicts whether an employee will leave the company based on their department, number of projects, average monthly hours, and any other data points.  
- Performed **data exploration, data cleaning, logistic regression model building, and model assumptions checking.  
- Visualized trends with box plots and scatterplots to identify key success drivers, create correlation heatmaps, confusion matix and decision tree splits.
- Construct a Decison tree model and a Random forest model and set up cross validated grid-search for both models, perform feature engineering to droping and creating new variables to improve on the models. 
**Skills:** Data cleaning, statistical analysis, data visualization, correlation matrices, histogram plotting, confusion matrices.  
**Tech:** Python (Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, sklearn).  
**Results:**
